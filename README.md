Assignment for MFA D+T Spring '14 Dynamic Interfaces class: make something magical using Node.js.
Oculus/Arduino is a virtual world that is controlled using physical objects.

To run, cd into the directory, let npm install modules, run node server.js in terminal and navigate to localhost:8080/index.html.
The progam uses Oculus Bridge to establish communication between the Oculus headtracking and the web browser.
You can download the oculus bridge from here: https://github.com/Instrument/oculus-bridge.

We used @samsniderheld's Oculus-Rift-Three.js-Boilerplate for this assignment:
